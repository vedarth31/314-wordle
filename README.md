Run the configuration for Main, which will launch an instance of the Wordle game.
Choose letters on the keyboard in order to make a word on a row, and click 'Enter' when ready to make a guess.
If you make a mistake in typing a word out, use 'Del' to delete the most recent letter. 
Upon making a guess, the game will provide you with clues as to what the final answer is.
When you win/lose the game, a new pop-up will be provided where you can see all the statistics for that instance of the Wordle game.
Play again can be clicked to start the game with a new word.

If you are halfway through a game and decide you want to play later, you can save all the guesses so far.
After clicking reset or opening a new instance of the game, you can click the load button to get the previous progress back.
